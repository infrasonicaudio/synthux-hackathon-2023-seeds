# SynthUX Hackathon 2023: DaisyDuino Seed Projects

My DaisyDuino tutorial/template projects created for the
[2023 SynthUX Hackathon](https://www.synthux.academy/hackathon-2023) as
starting points for student projects. Some of these have been used by
the students at Design Academy Eindhoven for the hackathon.

They are "Seed" projects in two senses of the word:
* They are written for the Daisy Seed platform
* They are intended as starting points from which projects can be further developed

See README in each project directory for more details.
