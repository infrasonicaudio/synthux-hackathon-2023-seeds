# SynthUX Hackathon 2023: DaisyDuino Seed Projects

My DaisyDuino tutorial/template projects created for the
[2023 SynthUX Hackathon](https://www.synthux.academy/hackathon-2023) as
starting points for student projects. These have been used by the students
at Design Academy Eindhoven.

They are "Seed" projects in two senses of the word:
* They are written for the Daisy Seed platform
* They are intended as starting points from which projects can be furether developed

See README in each project directory for more details.
